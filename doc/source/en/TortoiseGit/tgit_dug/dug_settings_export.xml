	<title>Exporting TortoiseGit Settings</title>
	<para>
		If you want to export all your client settings to use on another computer
		you can do so using the Windows registry editor <filename>regedt32.exe</filename>.
		Go to the registry key <filename>HKCU\Software\TortoiseGit</filename> and export it
		to a reg file. On the other computer, just import that file again (usually, a
		double click on the reg file will do that).

	<para>
		Remember to save Git's general settings, which you can find in the Git
		configuration file <filename>.gitconfig</filename> and/or the folder <filename>.config/git</filename>
		which both are located in your user profile directory.
